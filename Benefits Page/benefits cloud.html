			Cloud computing is simply the storing and the approaching data through the internet instead of a hard drive. What are the benefits though?
			<br />
			<br />
			<br />
			1. <b>Work anywhere-</b> Wherever you maybe be, with cloud computing you can be at work with just internet connection. You can also be on task with a only mobile device at hand. The result of this is that employees can access their work easily and at any time.
			<br />
			<br />
			<br />
			2.<b>Security-</b> Losing devices is a common problem. Now if you lose your device, the sensitive and important data can be lost or stolen. However, with cloud computing, your data is stored in the cloud so you can access the information no matter what damage is done to your device. You can also delete the data from the lost device before it gets into the wrong hands.
			<br />
			<br />
			<br />
			3.<b>Speed-</b> In cloud computing, you do not have to setup any devices by hand. This allows people to quickly upload their data and get to work faster. Nothing needs to be setup, only downloaded. Also, multiple people can access the resources you upload in certain cloud setups and can be working at the same time. Using cloud computing eliminates the need to save things to your computer because many automatically save which saves you time.
			<br />
			<br />
			<br />
			4.<b>Cost-</b> Using cloud computing reduces your spending on hard drives and buying more storage for your devices. If you use cloud storage then you can just pay depending on how much storage you need. There are even free apps that provide storage for one hundred gigabytes of data! You won't have to worry about running out of storage anytime soon with a cloud storage plan.
			<br />
			<br />
			<br />
			5.<b>Education-</b> Cloud computing allows for the use of virtualized resources on the internet and will have a large effect on the educational system in the future. It provides a great alternative for schools and universities that have a tight budget to be able to operate their information systems without having to spend more per device.  Many universities take advantage of cloud-based applications offered by their service providers which in turn allow for students to perform scholastic and business tasks.
