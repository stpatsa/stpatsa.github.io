	1.<b>Backup:</b>Backing up information is a time-consuming and complicated process. You would have to do many tedious things just to make sure your data is backed up. Instead of doing these complex things, you can use cloud. Cloud computing allows you to automatically transmit data without worrying about capacity, security, nor availability.
	<br />
	<br />
     2.<b>File Storage:</b>This is one of the most major uses of cloud computing. Cloud Computing allows you to store your files from any web enabled interface. At any location and time, you have speed, security, and availability. Businesses only pay for the storage you are using, so you do not have to worry constantly about storage infrastructure.
	<br />
	<br />
     3.<b>Disaster Recovery:</b>Businesses often experience difficult situations with disaster recovery. This is a where cloud computing comes in. With cloud computing, disaster recovery is cheaper, faster and effective compared to the expensive, stiff procedures.

	4.<b>Online Applications:</b>A commonly used program by many students, adults, and professionals, Google Documents allows for easy access to all of your saved documents. These documents can range from a simple note typed in a hurry to a doctorial thesis written over the span of two semesters. Google Documents relies on cloud computing servers to store and send data from the device used to write the document to anywhere where Google Documents is accessible.
					    But online applications don't have to be only for the hard working professional or student, Adobe Photoshop Express also utilizes cloud computing servers to allows you to easily edit and share photos. With the widely ranging and ever growing software industry, the number of programs relying on cloud computing technology is increasing and shows no sign of stopping.
