	<li><b>Security:</b> Although security can be a benefit in cloud computing, it can also be a big challenge. When you start storing information in cloud computing, you might not know exactly where your information is going exactly. This might lead to hacks or broken authentication. More than 60% of all cloud storage sites don't have the proper firewalls and antiviruses they should have. The cost of having full time monitors looking after the data stored can pile uo and may not be something that your cloud storage site wants to invest in or maintain. </li>
	<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	<li><b>Cloud set-up:</b> When people start to use cloud computing, they might not be sure on how to set up their account (public, private, or hybrid) People might not choose the right set ups and this can lead to data security issues. This can result in the imroper storage of your informaton or in others having access to an account you thought was private. Not knowing how to manage a certain cloud account is something that many consumers don't know how to do so companies must find a way to make it as simple as possible.</li>
	<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	<li><b>Lost Data Recovery:</b> Sometimes cloud comuputing can cause data loss. As a result of this, proper backup policies must be placed for the loss. All the cloud computing services must be set up where there are proper arrangements for the backup for a least 2 locations. This doesn't gurantee the security of the other two locations and finding a way to balance the backup costs while not charging a high price can cause issues.</li>
	<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	<li><b>Shared Access:</b> Even though letting multiple users in for cloud computing might be a benefit, it can still lean more to the challenge and lead to risks. Because of multiple users, there are more shared information and can result in a big privacy matter. The information shared can get into the wrong hands or someone could grant a third party access to the storage.</li>
	<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	<li><b>Cyber Attacks:</b> If you store data in cloud computing, there is always a risk of cyber attacks. Therefore, the datas stored always need to have extra protection, which can be a challenge for some cloud computing users. Since many companies don't have the adequate protection to deal with these kinds of attacks, it's highly recommended you do your research before you choose a cloud computing storage site.</li>
